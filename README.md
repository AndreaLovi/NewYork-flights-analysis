# NewYork-flights-analysis
We use the flights dataset in the nycflights13 package of Rstudio. This dataset contains airline data for all flights that departed NYC (i.e. JFK, LGA or EWR) in 2013.

The required output consists of several graphs able of summarizing different aspects, from the number of flights connecting specific airports to the expectation of a flight to start and arrive late depending on the different routes.
